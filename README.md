# AOC 2025
Advent of code 2025, if it happens

This year I'm going to try to create a Python template to help me first solve the puzzle quickly in Python. Then, after both stars are in hand for that day, I will do a version in Rust along with any optimizations that seem interesting. The first few days might see both in the same day, but later days I would expect the Rust version to trail by days to weeks.  
I will also look at making some commonly used helper/example Python files. Things like a linked list, an example using NetworkX and a 2D matrix map load. These seem common enough in AOC and would be good practice to create
