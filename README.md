# AOC 2025
Advent of code 2025, twelve days this year

This year I'm going to try to create a Python template to help me first solve the puzzle quickly in Python. Then, after both stars are in hand for that day, I will do a version in Rust along with any optimizations that seem interesting. The first few days might see both in the same day, but later days I would expect the Rust version to trail by days to weeks.  
I will also look at making some commonly used helper/example Python files. Things like a linked list, an example using NetworkX and a 2D matrix map load. These seem common enough in AOC and would be good practice to create

## Templates and Examples
* Python Template: I did make a template file for Python and it seemed fine when used with day 1. It's very simple, but includes a decorator to time the parts
* Linked List Class: ...

## Python
* Day 1: Getting to a version that runs for both parts was straight forward. I didn't try any optimization as it seemed the type of puzzle where anything would finish pretty quickly. Part 1 was 0.001 seconds and part 2 was 0.04 seconds. I should have started on-time, made a file for the day and changed variables for the day ahead of time to get the two stars faster. In a day or two, I'm sure these will not matter ;-)
* Day 2: ...


## Rust
* Day 1: Did you know that Rust "%" is not modulus, but remainder and can be negative? I also made part 2 in Rust more efficient, because it's Rust and that's part of the choice. Those two items made it take way longer than I though it would. Part 1 and 2 each took about 0.0003 seconds
* Day 2: ...
